                Started off working on UniVerse, and later jBASE, systems for the first few years. This included system administration of Unix, and later various Linux, systems. Cross trained to Delphi, outside office hours, creating a small Windows application which is still currently in use internally. Soon became an integral part of the Delphi team working on the main POS products. Roles included:      • Delphi development as part of a small team.      • Source control using CVS and later Subversion.      • Craft SQL to access the Firebird databases used to store the POS data.      • Design and create various reports for end users.
